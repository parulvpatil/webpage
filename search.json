    "text": "Experience\n\nStatistical Collaborator, Statistical Applications and Innovations Group, Virginia Tech\nAssisted 15+ clients from industry and academia with designing their experiments, performing analysis, creating useful visuals, and provided guidance in methods that can be used to answer their research questions. Conducted weekly walk-in sessions to guide clients with their analyses and approve methodologies, and troubleshoot or debug code as necessary. Developed, reviewed, taught, and piloted short courses such as Linear Regression, Mixed Models and Bootstrapping in R.\nGraduate Teaching Assistant, Virginia Tech\nAssisted with grading assignments for 50-100 students enrolled in graduate and undergraduate courses such as Biological Statistics, Engineering Statistics, Design of Experiments as well as a course in Computational Modelling and Data Analysis. Held office hours to help students with the course, provided guidance and cleared concepts one on one.\nQuality Control Intern, Xpress Minds Edutainment Pvt. Ltd., India\nApplied Six Sigma techniques to minimize the time spent while optimizing the number of registrations and increased the total number of registrations from 700,000 to 1 million. Performed weekly quality and hygiene audits to ensure productivity of 20+ business development executives were up to the mark. Forecasted the expected daily number of registrations for the upcoming month based on historical daily data from the past year."
